# Shawn's Wiki.js Docker image
Forked from the official one (that is under development and out of date) from <a href="https://github.com/Requarks/wiki-docker">Requarks/wiki-docker</a>

**This one is also under development and should not be used!**

In the meantime, you should install Wiki.js manually by following the [Get Started](https://wiki.requarks.io/get-started.html) guide.
